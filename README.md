Create a file input.txt with the contents described in the section Input/Output data format .
Put the input.txt into a folder with your_solution.jar file (the name of the jar file doesn't matter).
Open the command line in the same folder. Run java -Xmx128M -jar your_solution.jar. Use your file name instead of "your_solution".
Assuming your solution works correctly, output.txt file should appear in the same folder, with the contents identical to what is shown in the Input/Output data format section.
